* Installation
** Quick Installation
=git clone https://github.com/MicLennartz/dot-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d=

Keep in mind that you should remove your own ~/.emacs and your ~/.emacs.d
prior to cloning this configuration. The next time you launch Emacs (and I recommend
launching emacs in the tty for the first time) it's going to download a good amount
of packages and configure them for you, you might see warnings and errors being
displayed as well, those are safe to ignore as long as you relaunch emacs and
see none.

The configuration, much like emacs is self documented, I highly recommend reading
through my ramblings in their entirety.
** Less Quick Installation
You are free to pick out bits and pieces of this and apply them.
So long as you have a working =use-package= configuration (take a peek at my init.el),
there should be absolutely no issues.
I highly encourage you to read up on the prose around the packages you are interested in,
I do my absolute best to describe the configuration as well as I only can, this might help you on your emacs journey!
Have some fun with it, add your own keybindings, change parameters, it's your editor in the end.

* Dependencies for:
** TRAMP
*** From the package manager:
- =sudo=, properly configured for your user.
** Programming
*** Package manager
- =clang=, for c/c++ completion.
- =sbcl=, for clisp completion and repl.
- =virtualenv=, for python completion.
- =lua=, for obvious reasons.

*** pip
- =pip install jedi flake8 autopep8=, here, a one line install.
*** Jupyter / iPython
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
brew install ipython jupyter
#+END_SRC
** Org / Babel
*** Package manager
*** pip
- =ansible=, for ob-ansible
- =junos-eznc=, for junos-mode
* Environment
The have the search path from shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :ensure t
    :config
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+END_SRC

* Some notes
** On use-package some more
We utilize use-package to handle downloading and configuring other packages painlessly.
With =init.el= written the way it is, emacs checks for the presence of =use-package=
on launch and downloads it and installs if necessary.
=el-Get= is too old and not configurable enough.

To support package installations from e.g. GitHub, the =straight.el= package manager is added to use-package.

** On the format of the configuration
As you may have noticed, as you scroll down my bit of prose, this is the configuration file itself.
This configuration is written in =org-mode=, which is a great emacs package and a great markup language.
On launch, this file is being sourced into =~/.emacs.d/init.el=, the prose is being automatically
stripped (as to not affect performance) and the remaining =config.el= file is parsed.

This is also the reason why your org-mode configuration file is never called =init.org=.

** On the use case of this configuration
This entire config is meant to be used as a full on desktop environment, it is tailored to sit on top of xorg and be awesome.
It is perfectly possible to use it without exwm and emms, as a regular emacs config, just make sure to delete the unwanted sections,
ex.g EXWM, Audio Control, EMMS and all the launchers.
There is barely any learning curve to using =exwm=, since it makes x-windows act as regular buffers as much as possible,
so chances are, as long as you know your way around emacs itself, you will instinctively know how to make use of its features.

** On the keybindings
I do my best to not pollute keymaps with my own keybindings. Most of the bindings I defined myself utilize the Super key (noted as =s-=).
This is the least used modifier key together with Shift (noted as =S-=), thus using those, chances are all the bindings you already know
and love are going to work flawlessly. For all the others, just keep on reading.

* Straight.el
Here we add straight.el to the package manager. This is used to install packages from sources other than MELPA.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar bootstrap-version)
  (let ((bootstrap-file
         (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
        (bootstrap-version 5))
    (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
      (with-current-buffer
          (url-retrieve-synchronously
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
           'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (eval-print-last-sexp)))
    (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))

  (straight-use-package '(org :type built-in))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t

* Theme
The most important part of every configuration.
** A nice theme
My new favourite one I guess, really decent default values.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-themes
    :ensure t
    :init
      (load-theme 'doom-tomorrow-night t))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Basic Interface Settings
These are setting that do not depend on packages and are built-in enhancements to the UI.

** Looks
*** Remove lame startup screen
We use an actual replacement for it, keep reading or head directly to =dashboard=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
#+END_SRC
*** Disable menus and scrollbars
If you like using any of those, change =-1= to =1=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC
*** Disable bell
This is annoying, remove this line if you like being visually reminded of events.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+END_SRC
*** Set UTF-8 encoding
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+END_SRC
*** Highligh current line
=hl-line= is awesome! It's not very awesome in the terminal version of emacs though, so we don't use that.
Besides, it's only used for programming.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (hl-line-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** Pretty symbols
Changes =lambda= to an actual symbol and a few others as well, only in the GUI version though.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
        (use-package pretty-mode
        :ensure t
        :config
        (global-pretty-mode t)))
#+END_SRC

** Functionality
*** Disable backups and auto-saves
I don't use either, you might want to turn those from =nil= to =t= if you do.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq make-backup-files nil)
(setq auto-save-default nil)
#+END_SRC

*** Change yes-or-no questions into y-or-n questions
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

*** Async
Lets us use asynchronous processes wherever possible, pretty useful.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package async
    :ensure t
    :init (dired-async-mode 1))
#+END_SRC
* Projectile
Projectile is an awesome project manager, mostly because it recognizes directories
with a =.git= directory as projects and helps you manage them accordingly.

** Enable projectile globally
This makes sure that everything can be a project.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package projectile
      :ensure t
      :init
        (projectile-mode 1)
      :config
        (setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/proj/"))
        (setq projectile-completion-system 'helm))

    (use-package helm-projectile
      :ensure t
      :bind
      ("C-c p h" . 'helm-projectile)
      ("C-c p p" . 'helm-projectile-switch-project)
      ("C-c p f" . 'helm-projectile-find-file)
      ("C-c p F" . 'helm-projectile-find-file-in-known-projects)
      ("C-c p g" . 'helm-projectile-find-file-dwim)
      ("C-c p d" . 'helm-projectile-find-dir)
      ("C-c p e" . 'helm-projectile-recentf)
      ("C-c p a" . 'helm-projectile-find-other-file)
      ("C-c p i" . 'projectile-invalidate-cache)
      ("C-c p z" . 'projectile-cache-current-file)
      ("C-c p b" . 'helm-projectile-switch-to-buffer)
      ("C-c p s g" . 'helm-projectile-grep)
      ("C-c p s a" . 'helm-projectile-ack)
      ("C-c p s s" . 'helm-projectile-ag))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: helm-projectile-ag

** Let projectile call make
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'projectile-compile-project)
#+END_SRC
* Dashboard
This is your new startup screen, together with projectile it works in unison and
provides you with a quick look into your latest projects and files.
Change the welcome message to whatever string you want and
change the numbers to suit your liking, I find 5 to be enough.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dashboard
    :ensure t
    :config
      (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
      (setq dashboard-startup-banner "~/.emacs.d/img/dashLogo.png")
      (setq dashboard-items '((recents  . 5)
                              (projects . 5)))
      (setq dashboard-banner-logo-title ""))
#+END_SRC

* Modeline
The modeline is the heart of emacs, it offers information at all times, it's persistent
and verbose enough to gain a full understanding of modes and states you are in.


Due to the fact that we attempt to use emacs as a desktop environment replacement,
and external bar showing the time, the battery percentage and more system info would be great to have.
I have however abandoned polybar in favor of a heavily modified modeline, this offers me more space
on the screen and better integration.


One modeline-related setting that is missing and is instead placed at the bottom is =diminish=.
** DoomLine!
I may not use doom emacs, since I do not like evil-mode and find doom incredibly bloated and slow,
however it would be stupid not to acknowledge the best parts about it, the theme and their modified powerline setup.

This enables the doom modeline, it looks better and works very well with my theme of choice.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-modeline
        :ensure t
        :hook (after-init . doom-modeline-mode)
        :config
        (setq doom-modeline-height 25)
        (setq doom-modeline-bar-width 3)
        (setq doom-modeline-project-detection 'projectile))
#+END_SRC

** No separator!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq powerline-default-separator nil)
#+END_SRC

** Cursor position
Show the current line and column for your cursor.
We are not going to have =relative-linum-mode= in every major mode, so this is useful.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq line-number-mode t)
  (setq column-number-mode t)
#+END_SRC
* File manager
Abandoning sunrise-commander.
The repos are dead and I'm looking for something better anyway.

* The terminal
I have used urxvt for years, and I miss it sometimes, but ansi-term is enough for most of my tasks.

** Default shell should be zsh
I don't know why this is a thing, but asking me what shell to launch every single
time I open a terminal makes me want to slap babies, this gets rid of it.
This goes without saying but you can replace bash with your shell of choice.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar my-term-shell "/bin/zsh")
  (defadvice ansi-term (before force-bash)
    (interactive (list my-term-shell)))
  (ad-activate 'ansi-term)
#+END_SRC

** Easy to remember keybinding
In loving memory of bspwm, Super + Enter opens a new terminal, old habits die hard.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<s-return>") 'ansi-term)
#+END_SRC
* Moving around emacs
One of the most important things about a text editor is how efficient you manage
to be when using it, how much time do basic tasks take you and so on and so forth.
One of those tasks is moving around files and buffers, whatever you may use emacs for
you /will/ be jumping around buffers like it's serious business, the following
set of enhancements aims to make it easier.

As a great emacs user once said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Do me the favor, do me the biggest favor, matter of fact do yourself the biggest favor and integrate those into your workflow.
#+END_QUOTE

** a prerequisite for others packages
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ivy
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** scrolling and why does the screen move
I don't know to be honest, but this little bit of code makes scrolling with emacs a lot nicer.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq scroll-conservatively 100)
#+END_SRC

** which-key and why I love emacs
In order to use emacs, you don't need to know how to use emacs.
It's self documenting, and coupled with this insanely useful package, it's even easier.
In short, after you start the input of a command and stop, pondering what key must follow,
it will automatically open a non-intrusive buffer at the bottom of the screen offering
you suggestions for completing the command, that's it, nothing else.

It's beautiful
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :ensure t
    :config
      (which-key-mode))
#+END_SRC

** windows,panes and why I hate other-window
Some of us have large displays, others have tiny netbook screens, but regardless of your hardware
you probably use more than 2 panes/windows at times, cycling through all of them with
=C-c o= is annoying to say the least, it's a lot of keystrokes and takes time, time you could spend doing something more productive.

*** switch-window
This magnificent package takes care of this issue.
It's unnoticeable if you have <3 panes open, but with 3 or more, upon pressing =C-x o=
you will notice how your buffers turn a solid color and each buffer is asigned a letter
(the list below shows the letters, you can modify them to suit your liking), upon pressing
a letter asigned to a window, your will be taken to said window, easy to remember, quick to use
and most importantly, it annihilates a big issue I had with emacs. An alternative is =ace-window=,
however by default it also changes the behaviour of =C-x o= even if only 2 windows are open,
this is bad, it also works less well with =exwm= for some reason.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package switch-window
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)
    (setq switch-window-increase 4)
    (setq switch-window-threshold 2)
    (setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
    (setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
          '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" "i" "o"))
    :bind
      ([remap other-window] . switch-window))
#+END_SRC

*** PFollowing window splits
After you split a window, your focus remains in the previous one.
This annoyed me so much I wrote these two, they take care of it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun split-and-follow-horizontally ()
    (interactive)
    (split-window-below)
    (balance-windows)
    (other-window 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 2") 'split-and-follow-horizontally)

  (defun split-and-follow-vertically ()
    (interactive)
    (split-window-right)
    (balance-windows)
    (other-window 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 3") 'split-and-follow-vertically)
#+END_SRC

** swiper and why is the default search so lame
I like me some searching, the default search is very meh. In emacs, you mostly use search to get around your buffer, much like with avy, but sometimes it doesn't hurt to search for entire words or mode, swiper makes sure this is more efficient.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package swiper
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-s" . 'swiper))
#+END_SRC

** buffers and why I hate list-buffers
Another big thing is, buffers. If you use emacs, you use buffers, everyone loves them.
Having many buffers is useful, but can be tedious to work with, let us see how we can improve it.

*** Always murder current buffer
Doing =C-x k= should kill the current buffer at all times, we have =ibuffer= for more sophisticated thing.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun kill-current-buffer ()
    "Kills the current buffer."
    (interactive)
    (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'kill-current-buffer)
#+END_SRC

*** Kill buffers without asking for confirmation
Unless you have the muscle memory, I recommend omitting this bit, as you may lose progress for no reason when working.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq kill-buffer-query-functions (delq 'process-kill-buffer-query-function kill-buffer-query-functions))
#+END_SRC

*** Turn switch-to-buffer into ibuffer
I don't understand how ibuffer isn't the default option by now.
It's vastly superior in terms of ergonomics and functionality, you can delete buffers, rename buffer, move buffers, organize buffers etc.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x b") 'ibuffer)
#+END_SRC

**** expert-mode
If you feel like you know how ibuffer works and need not to be asked for confirmation after every serious command, enable this as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ibuffer-expert t)
#+END_SRC
*** close-all-buffers
It's one of those things where I genuinely have to wonder why there is no built in functionality for it.
Once in a blue moon I need to kill all buffers, and having ~150 of them open would mean I'd need to spend a few too many
seconds doing this than I'd like, here's a solution.

This can be invoked using =C-M-s-k=. This keybinding makes sure you don't hit it unless you really want to.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun close-all-buffers ()
    "Kill all buffers without regard for their origin."
    (interactive)
    (mapc 'kill-buffer (buffer-list)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s-k") 'close-all-buffers)
#+END_SRC

** ido and why I started using helm
Sometimes, you don't realize how good something is until you try it extensively.
I give in, helm is awesome. I'll end up customizing it more eventually,
it's rather similar to ido-vertical though.
*** helm
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :ensure t
    :bind
    ("C-x C-f" . 'helm-find-files)
    ("C-x f" .   'helm-recentf)
    ("C-x C-b" . 'helm-buffers-list)
    ("M-x" . 'helm-M-x)
    :config
    (defun daedreth/helm-hide-minibuffer ()
      (when (with-helm-buffer helm-echo-input-in-header-line)
        (let ((ov (make-overlay (point-min) (point-max) nil nil t)))
          (overlay-put ov 'window (selected-window))
          (overlay-put ov 'face
                       (let ((bg-color (face-background 'default nil)))
                         `(:background ,bg-color :foreground ,bg-color)))
          (setq-local cursor-type nil))))
    (add-hook 'helm-minibuffer-set-up-hook 'daedreth/helm-hide-minibuffer)

#+END_SRC

** avy and why it's the best thing in existence
Many times have I pondered how I can move around buffers even quicker.
I'm glad to say, that avy is precisely what I needed, and it's precisely what you need as well.
In short, as you invoke one of avy's functions, you will be prompted for a character
that you'd like to jump to in the /visible portion of the current buffer/.
Afterwards you will notice how all instances of said character have additional letter on top of them.
Pressing those letters, that are next to your desired character will move your cursor over there.
Admittedly, this sounds overly complicated and complex, but in reality takes a split second
and improves your life tremendously.

I like =M-s= for it, same as =C-s= is for moving by searching string, now =M-s= is moving by searching characters.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package avy
    :ensure t
    :bind
      ("M-s" . avy-goto-char))
#+END_SRC
* Text manipulation
Here I shall collect self-made functions that make editing text easier.
** Multi-cursor
Multiple cursors for Emacs. This is some pretty crazy functionality, so yes, there are kinks.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package multiple-cursors
    :ensure t
    :bind
    ("s-." . 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
    ("s->" . 'mc/unmark-next-like-this)
    ("s-," . 'mc/mark-previous-like-thisd)
    ("s-<" . 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
    ("s-/" . 'mc/edit-lines))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mc/edit-lines

** Improved kill-word
Why on earth does a function called =kill-word= not .. kill a word.
It instead deletes characters from your cursors position to the end of the word,
let's make a quick fix and bind it properly.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun daedreth/kill-inner-word ()
    "Kills the entire word your cursor is in. Equivalent to 'ciw' in vim."
    (interactive)
    (forward-char 1)
    (backward-word)
    (kill-word 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c w k") 'daedreth/kill-inner-word)
#+END_SRC

** Improved copy-word
And again, the same as above but we make sure to not delete the source word.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun daedreth/copy-whole-word ()
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (forward-char 1)
      (backward-word)
      (kill-word 1)
      (yank)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c w c") 'daedreth/copy-whole-word)
#+END_SRC

** Copy a line
Regardless of where your cursor is, this quickly copies a line.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun daedreth/copy-whole-line ()
    "Copies a line without regard for cursor position."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (kill-new
       (buffer-substring
        (point-at-bol)
        (point-at-eol)))))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l c") 'daedreth/copy-whole-line)
#+END_SRC

** Kill a line
And this quickly deletes a line.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l k") 'kill-whole-line)
#+END_SRC
** Copy line or region
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun copy-to-end-of-line ()
  (interactive)
  (kill-ring-save (point)
                  (line-end-position))
  (message "Copied to end of line"))

(defun copy-line (arg)
  "Copy to end of line, or as many lines as prefix argument"
  (interactive "P")
  (if (null arg)
      (copy-to-end-of-line)
    (copy-whole-lines (prefix-numeric-value arg))))

#+RESULTS:

* Minor conveniences
Emacs is at it's best when it just does things for you, shows you the way, guides you so to speak.
This can be best achieved using a number of small extensions. While on their own they might not be particularly
impressive. Together they create a nice environment for you to work in.

** Visiting the configuration
Quickly edit =~/.emacs.d/config.org=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun config-visit ()
    (interactive)
    (find-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org"))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e") 'config-visit)
#+END_SRC

** Reloading the configuration
   
Simply pressing =Control-c r= will reload this file, very handy.
You can also manually invoke =config-reload=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun config-reload ()
    "Reloads ~/.emacs.d/config.org at runtime"
    (interactive)
    (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/config.org")))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'config-reload)
#+END_SRC

** Subwords
Emacs treats camelCase strings as a single word by default, this changes said behaviour.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-subword-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Electric
If you write any code, you may enjoy this.
Typing the first character in a set of 2, completes the second one after your cursor.
Opening a bracket? It's closed for you already. Quoting something? It's closed for you already.

You can easily add and remove pairs yourself, have a look.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq electric-pair-pairs '(
                           (?\{ . ?\})
                           (?\( . ?\))
                           (?\[ . ?\])
                           (?\" . ?\")
                           ))
#+END_SRC

And now to enable it
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(electric-pair-mode t)
#+END_SRC

** Beacon
While changing buffers or workspaces, the first thing you do is look for your cursor.
Unless you know its position, you can not move it efficiently. Every time you change
buffers, the current position of your cursor will be briefly highlighted now.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package beacon
    :ensure t
    :config
      (beacon-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** Rainbow
Mostly useful if you are into web development or game development.
Every time emacs encounters a hexadecimal code that resembles a color, it will automatically highlight
it in the appropriate color. This is a lot cooler than you may think.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-mode
    :ensure t
    :init
      (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Show parens
I forgot about that initially, it highlights matching parens when the cursor is just behind one of them.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (show-paren-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
** Rainbow delimiters
Colors parentheses and other delimiters depending on their depth, useful for any language using them,
especially lisp.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :ensure t
    :init
      (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Expand region
A pretty simple package, takes your cursor and semantically expands the region, so words, sentences, maybe the contents of some parentheses, it's awesome, try it out.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package expand-region
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-q" . er/expand-region))
#+END_SRC

** Hungry deletion
On the list of things I like doing, deleting big whitespaces is pretty close to the bottom.
Backspace or Delete will get rid of all whitespace until the next non-whitespace character is encountered.
You may not like it, thus disable it if you must, but it's pretty decent.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package hungry-delete
    :ensure t
    :config
      (global-hungry-delete-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Zapping to char
A nifty little package that kills all text between your cursor and a selected character.
A lot more useful than you might think. If you wish to include the selected character in the killed region,
change =zzz-up-to-char= into =zzz-to-char=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package zzz-to-char
    :ensure t
    :bind ("M-z" . zzz-up-to-char))
#+END_SRC
* Kill ring
There is a lot of customization to the kill ring, and while I have not used it much before,
I decided that it was time to change that.
** Maximum entries on the ring
The default is 60, I personally need more sometimes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq kill-ring-max 100)
#+END_SRC

** popup-kill-ring
Out of all the packages I tried out, this one, being the simplest, appealed to me most.
With a simple M-y you can now browse your kill-ring like browsing autocompletion items.
C-n and C-p totally work for this.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package popup-kill-ring
    :ensure t
    :bind ("M-y" . popup-kill-ring))
#+END_SRC
* Programming
Minor, non-completion related settings and plugins for writing code.

** yasnippet
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package yasnippet
      :ensure t
      :config
        (use-package yasnippet-snippets
          :ensure t)
        (yas-reload-all))
#+END_SRC

** flycheck
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** company mode
I set the delay for company mode to kick in to half a second, I also make sure that
it starts doing its magic after typing in only 2 characters.

I prefer =C-n= and =C-p= to move around the items, so I remap those accordingly.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq company-idle-delay 0)
    (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3))

  (with-eval-after-load 'company
    (define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-n") nil)
    (define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-p") nil)
    (define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-n") #'company-select-next)
    (define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-p") #'company-select-previous)
    (define-key company-active-map (kbd "SPC") #'company-abort))
#+END_SRC

** specific languages
Be it for code or prose, completion is a must.
After messing around with =auto-completion= and =company= for a while I decided to .. use both?
AC is for Lua/LÖVE and Company for the rest.

Each category also has additional settings.

** Jupyter integration
The emacs-jupyter module seems to be the most complete and recent.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package jupyter
  :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

* Git integration
Countless are the times where I opened ansi-term to use =git= on something.
These times are also something that I'd prefer stay in the past, since =magit= is
great. It's easy and intuitive to use, shows its options at a keypress and much more.
** magit
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* Remote editing
I have no need to directly edit files over SSH, but what I do need is a way to edit files as root.
Opening up nano in a terminal as root to play around with grubs default settings is a no-no, this solves that.

** Editing with sudo
Pretty self-explanatory, useful as hell if you use exwm.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* Org
One of the absolute greatest features of emacs is called "org-mode".
This very file has been written in org-mode, a lot of other configurations are written in org-mode, same goes for
academic papers, presentations, schedules, blogposts and guides.
Org-mode is one of the most complex things ever, lets make it a bit more usable with some basic configuration.


Those are all rather self-explanatory.

** Common settings

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-ellipsis " ")
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
  (setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

#+END_SRC

** Keybindings
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

** Org Bullets and Symbols
Makes it all look a bit nicer, I hate looking at asterisks.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-bullets
    :ensure t
    :config
      (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode)))

                           (push '("[X]" . "☑" ) prettify-symbols-alist)
                           (push '("[-]" . "❍" ) prettify-symbols-alist)
                           (prettify-symbols-mode))))
#+END_SRC

** Easy-to-add emacs-lisp template
Hitting tab after an "<el" in an org-mode file will create a template for elisp insertion.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC
** Exporting options
One of the best things about org is the ability to export your file to many formats.
Here is how we add more of them!

*** latex
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (file-directory-p "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/tex-utils")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/tex-utils")

#+END_SRC
*** Twitter Bootstrap
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC
* Diminishing modes
Your modeline is sacred, and if you have a lot of modes enabled, as you will if you use this config,
you might end up with a lot of clutter there, the package =diminish= disables modes on the mode line but keeps
them running, it just prevents them from showing up and taking up space.

*THIS WILL BE REMOVED SOON AS USE-PACKAGE HAS THE FUNCTIONALITY BUILT IN*

Edit this list as you see fit!
